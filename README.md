       Change-friendly design.
       Powerful querying and analytics.
       Easy horizontal scale-out with sharding.
       Simple installation.
       Cost-effective.

WHAT IS PYTHON FLASK ?

       Flask is a web application framework written in Python. Armin Ronacher, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco, develops it. Flask is based on Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects.

   Benifits of python flask :

       It is a lightweight framework that offers hassle-free development.
       Provide flexibility to the developer to experiment with their modules or architecture.
       It is suitable for small projects.
       Offers a built-in development server and fast debugger.
       Easily scalable for the applications.
       Support for secure cookies. 

WHAT IS JENKINS ?

      Jenkins is a powerful application that allows continuous integration and continuous delivery of projects, regardless of the platform you are working on. It is a free source that can handle any kind of build or continuous integration. You can integrate Jenkins with a number of testing and deployment technologies. In this tutorial, we would explain how you can use Jenkins to build and test your software projects continuously.

  Advantages of Jenkins :
      User-friendly and easy to install. You do not require extra installations or tools with it.
      Platform-independent. ...
      Easy configuration. ...
      Rich plugin ecosystem. ...
      Free. ...
      Incredible support. ...
      Automated integration. ...
      Easily detectable errors.

WHAT IS DOCKER ?

     Docker an open-source project that automates the deployment of software applications inside containers by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of OS-level virtualization on Linux.

     Wow! That's a mouthful. In simpler words, Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.

What are containers:- 

      The industry standard today is to use Virtual Machines (VMs) to run software applications. VMs run applications inside a guest Operating System, which runs on virtual hardware powered by the server’s host OS.VMs are great at providing full process isolation for applications: there are very few ways a problem in the host operating system can affect the software running in the guest operating system, and vice-versa. But this isolation comes at great cost — the computational overhead spent virtualizing hardware for a guest OS to use is substantial.

      Containers take a different approach: by leveraging the low-level mechanics of the host operating system, containers provide most of the isolation of virtual machines at a fraction of the computing power.

Why use containers :-   
       Containers offer a logical packaging mechanism in which applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they actually run. This decoupling allows container-based applications to be deployed easily and consistently, regardless of whether the target environment is a private data center, the public cloud, or even a developer’s personal laptop. This gives developers the ability to create predictable environments that are isolated from the rest of the applications and can be run anywhere.

       From an operations standpoint, apart from portability containers also give more granular control over resources giving your infrastructure improved efficiency which can result in better utilization of your compute resources.

WHAT IS EKS ?

      Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that eliminates the need to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Kubernetes is an open-source system that automates the management, scaling, and deployment of containerized applications.

The following are key features of Amazon EKS:

            Secure networking and authentication
            Easy cluster scaling
            Managed Kubernetes experience
            High availability
            Integration with AWS services

Getting started with Amazon EKS :

      Many procedures of this user guide use the following command line tools:

      kubectl – A command line tool for working with Kubernetes clusters. For more information, see Installing or updating kubectl.

      eksctl – A command line tool for working with EKS clusters that automates many individual tasks. For more information, see Installing or updating eksctl.

      AWS CLI – A command line tool for working with AWS services, including Amazon EKS. For more information, see Installing, updating, and uninstalling the AWS CLI in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. After installing the AWS CLI, we recommend that you also configure it.


WHAT IS REACT JS ?

       React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

       React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component subclasses:

Some advantages of React js are:
       It is composable.
       It is declarative.
       Write once, and learn anywhere.
       It is simple.
       SEO friendly.
       Fast, efficient, and easy to learn.
       It guarantees stable code.
       It is backed by a strong community.
